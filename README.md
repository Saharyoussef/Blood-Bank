# Blood Donation Website
This project is a frontend-only web application designed to streamline and enhance the process of blood donation. It was developed during a one-month internship at Whitecape Technologies, Sousse, Tunisia in 2023.

# Project Overview
The Blood Donation Website serves as a centralized platform for donors, hospitals, and blood banks. It facilitates easy access to information and helps coordinate blood donation activities. The website features a landing page that includes information about hospitals, a blog, events, and a contact section. Additionally, it provides a dashboard for blood donors, with plans to extend it to include dashboards for blood banks, hospitals, and seekers.

# Key Features
**Landing Page
- Hospitals: A section dedicated to showcasing participating hospitals, their services, and contact details.
- Blog: A blog section featuring articles, news, and updates about blood donation.
- Events: Information about upcoming blood donation events, drives, and campaigns.
- Contact: A contact form and details for users to reach out with inquiries or for support.

**Dashboard
- Blood Donors:
Donor profiles that include basic details and donation history.
A list of hospitals and blood banks.
A section highlighting urgent cases requiring immediate blood donations.
- Blood Banks and Hospitals (In Development):
Dashboards to manage blood inventories and urgent cases.
Interfaces for blood banks and hospitals to coordinate and update their needs.
- Seekers (In Development):
A dashboard for seekers (patients or families in need) to submit requests and find blood donors or available blood banks.

# Technology Stack
**Frontend:
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for developing the website's interactive components.
- CSS: Custom styles to ensure a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
- Material-UI: A popular React UI framework that provides a collection of ready-to-use components, ensuring a consistent and modern look.

**Version Control:
- GitHub: Used for version control, allowing for collaboration and tracking of changes throughout the development process.

# Future Enhancements
- Complete the Dashboard: Extend the functionality to include full dashboards for blood banks, hospitals, and seekers, enabling better management of blood donation activities.
- Backend Integration: While the current version is frontend-only, future versions could integrate a backend for data management and API connections for real-time updates and communication.
- Enhanced User Experience: Implement additional features like notifications, advanced search and filtering, and mobile app integration.
